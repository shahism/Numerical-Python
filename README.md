# Numerical-Python
# Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures 
to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous 
library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.
